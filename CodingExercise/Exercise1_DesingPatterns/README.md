# Design Patterns Java Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of various **design patterns** in Java through practical examples. It serves as a learning resource to understand how different patterns can solve common software design problems.

## Design Patterns Included

- **Creational Patterns:**
  
   **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only a single instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
  **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, allowing object creation without depending on their concrete classes.
  
- **Structural Patterns:**
- 
        **Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.  
        **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, making it easier to use by hiding complex subsystem details.
- **Behavioral Patterns:**
- 
        **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.  
        **Strategy Pattern:** Enables selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime by defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.

## How to Run
    1.Import into IntelliJ or preferred IDE.
    2.Build and run desired modules as described.
    3.Follow input formats exactly for interactive parts.
## Notes
    1.The code is organized into packages according to pattern categories.
    2.Each package show focused implementation of a paritcular design pattern.
    3.code is commented to enhance the understanding.
    4.Ready to be discussed during your placements interview for demonstration.
